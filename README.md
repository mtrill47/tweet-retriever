# Twitter Retriever

### Janky quick way to retrieve your own tweets and search through them using specific words or phrases found in the tweets.

This did not take too long as I did not intend to make the code as clean as possible because this is from a pentester's perspective. I might decide to update the code here and there to make it all developer like or even add a whole interface and database to make it into a whole web app. That is all for later though.

#### Usage
> You can choose to either use just the terminal version or try the even jankier GUI version.

- For either version all you need to do is follow the installation and set up guide. You can find the installation and set up on my website [here](https://scriptkiddiehub.com/2021/09/07/twitter-scrapper-retrieving-my-tweets/).

- When trying to use the GUI version just make sure that all the python files are in the same directory as some functions are shared between them.
