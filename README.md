# Twitter Retriever

### Last Updated 07 September 2021
This did not take too long as I did not intend to make the code as clean as possible because this is from a pentester's perspective. I might decide to update the code here and there to make it all developer like or even add a whole interface and database to make it into a whole web app. That is all for later though.
